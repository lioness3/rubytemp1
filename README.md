README
Every project you create should include a README.md file in the root directory regardless of whether it is a Ruby project or not. A README should include all installation instructions as well as directions on using the application. For instance, it should tell the app user how to:

cd into the root directory and bundle the project;
run tests;
run any script files in the root directory.
Verify all necessary steps by cloning your application from Github and then documenting your application's setup instructions yourself.
